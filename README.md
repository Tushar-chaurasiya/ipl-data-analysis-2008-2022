# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis and Visualization (2008–2022)

This project focuses on analyzing 15 seasons of Indian Premier League (IPL) data (2008–2022) using **PostgreSQL** for data preprocessing and querying, and **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards. The goal is to uncover key performance insights about teams, players, match outcomes, and toss decisions.
